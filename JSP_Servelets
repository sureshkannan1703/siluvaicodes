Creating a simple servlet involves a few steps. Here's a basic outline:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup Your Development Environment: Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system, and preferably an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Create a Java Servlet Class: Start by creating a Java class that extends HttpServlet. This class will handle incoming HTTP requests and generate responses. Here's a simple example:

java
Copy code
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class SimpleServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("<html><body>");
        out.println("<h2>Hello, World!</h2>");
        out.println("</body></html>");
    }
}

Web.xml file :
----------------
The web.xml file is a deployment descriptor used in Java web applications, particularly in Servlet-based applications. It provides configuration information to the web server (like Apache Tomcat) about how to deploy and configure components of the web application, such as servlets, filters, and listeners.

How JSP page works?
--------------------
A request comes for JSP page.
Web container translates the JSP page into a servlet.
Compile the auto generated servlet class.
_JspService()method is called.
Dynamic content will be generated.
Send dynamically generated content as a response to the client.
