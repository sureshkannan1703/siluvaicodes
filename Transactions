Transactions :
---------------
1.Database operations concurrency achieved by Transactions.
  A - Atomicity
  C - Consistency
  I - Isolation
      Locks :[Database achieves concurrency between transaction through take lock on rows]
        Shared Locks -> Locked row always open for read operations. But Update transaction should wait for other running operations on the Locked row.
        Exclusive Locks -> Both READ/UPDATE operations should wait for other running transaction on the row.
      Types: [Performance get reduce when Isolation level increase.]
        1. READ UNCOMMITED(Dirty Read,No locks,Performance high)
        2. READ COMMITED 
        3. REPEATABLE READS -> Write needed Exclusive locks./Read with Update intent also needed exclusive locks.
        4. SERIALIZABLE ->
  D - Durability
